checkslate
==========

NOTE: This project was built to help me learn Angular, and is no longer maintained.

A single-page application built using Angular, which allows a user to re-use a checklist.

Often times, I have repeat tasks to accomplish. It's handy to be able to check them off, but annoying to repeatedly create the same checklist. Here's my solution.
